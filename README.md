This webpage hosts the exercise labsheets for Unit of study **Robotic Systems EMATM0054/53** running in academic year **2021/2022**.  You should have been directed here from Blackboard where there are further details on the Unit.

The Unit is split into two 6-week periods:
- **[ Weeks 1-6 ]** : A formative period of skill building.  You are presented with the Line Following Challenge to develop skill with a robotic system and it's evaluation.  Your learning is supported with weekly lab sessions and drop-in sessions facilitated by the teaching staff. 
- **[ Weeks 7-12 ]** : A summative period ending in an Assessment of a 6-page report on an experiment you have conducted with your Robotic System.  During this period, you will engage in self-directed study under supervision to design, implement, conduct, evaluate and document a scientific experiement in the context of robotics.

Please note that during weeks 7-12 technical support and training is greatly reduced - meaning that it is imperative that you engage in skill building during weeks 1-6.  For further information on the assessment specifics, please refer to the unit Blackboard Page. 

If you do not have access to a Pololu 3Pi+ mobile robot kit you can study via the Webots simulation of an e-puck robot. You may choose which platform you are using throughout the Unit.  The labsheets are presented as two sets:

## <a href="https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0053_21_22/blob/main/Pololu3PI.md">Pololu 3Pi+ Labsheets</a>
## <a href="https://github.com/paulodowd/EMATM0053_21_22/blob/main/Webots.md">Webots Simulator Labsheets</a>
